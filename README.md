# Databases
This is where I will upload the projects I work on as I progress through my database management journey. I took a Database Concepts (2545) course in the fall of 2022 and our primary focus was on MySQL and Relational Database Managment and I would say that I am proficient in MySQL. I also an Internet Applications (CGS 3175) course in the fall of 2022 and I hope to combine my skills in both web delvelopment and database management as I work on my Information Technology degree at the University of Central Florida.

Dealership: 
This is a database we worked on throughout the semster. As we learned new skills, we applied them by updating out database to be up to standards with database requirements.
