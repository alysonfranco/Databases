**DEALERSHIP**: This is a database we worked on throughout the semester. As we learned new skills, we applied them by updating our database to meet the standards of database requirements. The database represents a sample car dealership and is used to view information such as inventory and car details, as well as employee data and their commissions.

**CAP3104_GroupProject**: I took the initiative to create the database aspect of our final group project for my Foundations of Human-Computer Interaction course. We were required to upload the requirements, along with adding priority and updating the progress of our user interface assignment.
